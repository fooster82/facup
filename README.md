## To-do

### Add teams
[x] Add the drop-down components for each round to the tracker page
[x] Change the flow of state data for TeamToAdd from parent (SelectTeams) to child (DropdownMenu(s))
[] Match up a single drop-down with the logic currently on the home page that posts the data
[] Match up all the drop-down menus with the logic
[] Add an if-loop that checks if a user already has team data --> patch if they do, post if they don't

### Small things
[] Sort out secret key to be read from .env instead of just visible
[] Make the dropdown menu items have a scroll bar instead of just loading them all in
[] Alphabetise the dropdown menu
[] Dropdown menu arrow doesn't persist after the first option is made
[] Show password button submits the form
[] No checks to stop users having the same user name
[] Registering should have confirmation and log the user in or take them to the log in page
[] Add a dark mode
