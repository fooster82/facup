## To-do
### Drop-down menu
[x] Team data is undefined
[x] Get the drop-down menus to load in all the available teams
[] When a user starts to type, select the team that best matches what they've typed so far
[x] When selected, set the input box to that team
[x] Allow a user to also just click a team to select it which also closes the menu

### Add teams
[] Add the drop-down components for each round to the tracker page
[] Match up a single drop-down with the logic currently on the home page that posts the data
[] Match up all the drop-down menus with the logic
[] Add an if-loop that checks if a user already has team data --> patch if they do, post if they don't

### Small things
[] Sort out secret key to be read from .env instead of just visible
[] Make the dropdown menu items have a scroll bar instead of just loading them all in
[] Show password button submits the form
[] No checks to stop users having the same user name
[] Registering should have confirmation and log the user in or take them to the log in page
[x] Get the django admin page working for the deploy
